  <h1>Shark Attacks in Florida (2015-16)</h1>

  <div id="mapid2"></div>

  <p>The state of Florida is known for its beaches -- and, often, its shark attacks. Check out the map above for the locations of every shark attack in Florida between 2015-16. Each of these attacks was labelled as "unprovoked," and none of them were fatal.</p>

  <p>This map was constructed by Brittney Miller. The data about the shark attacks came from <a href="http://www.sharkattackdata.com/place/united_states_of_america/florida">Shark Attack Data</a>, which compiles its information from <a href="http://www.sharkattackfile.net/">the Global Shark Attack File</a>.</p>
